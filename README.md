# Dungeons and Dragons Map In-Game Editor
This is a pet project of creating a program for setting up and displaying a digital version of a Dungeons and Dragons encounter map. This is because making maps by hand can be too expensive, fragile, and time consuming. However you can't tear or spill drinks on a digital map, map-making software is available for free online, and with them you can make high quality maps even if you have little to no artistic skill. It is currently set for 1000x1000 pixel maps with 50x50 squares to make things simpler. Also this project uses the Processing IDE.

Goals:

Display maps [X]

place characters on Map [X]

Move characters freely on Map [X]

Indicate which characters are dead [X]

can reset the map at any time [X]

can add any number of maps or character icons [X]

can indicate on character icons any key except for 'r' or 's' for status effects or differentiation between similar characters [X]

can indicate an AOE with any square as the origin on the map [X]

group maps together to have preset maps (ex. Multiple floors to a building or multiple rooms to a dungeon) [ ]
